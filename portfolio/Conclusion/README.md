## 1. Conclusion on working practices of the group

The key part of the success of the project is efficient team play. The final completion is based on everyone's hard work and commitment to the team.

<a name="_1.1"></a>
### - Agile development (complete four sprint cycles)
This project has followed closely with agile development principles. We designed the system around user needs and kept them as our top priority. We were open to changes and adapted them quickly once they rose. We worked on development at a progressive pace by following our [timeline](../Sprints/README.md/#_s2). After each sprint we measured the progress by testing and review before moving on to the next sprint. 

We focused on coding implementation and tried to do our best with what we have. We minimized unnecessary work when adapting changes to our goal. We divided ourselves into two sub-groups with 2-3 teammates in each. Within each sub-group we organized tasks for our own and reflect regularly on what had been achieved.

<a name="_1.2"></a>
### - Team communication & management of issues
We arranged twice video calls on Teams weekly to make sure everyone would catch up with the progress as planned. We held a total of 19 online meetings. Our integrated meeting logs are [here](../Sprints/meeting_log/README.md). After each group meeting, we would always make a conclusion based on our discussion and allocate related members to follow up the issues. We used WeChat group in our daily work to communicate and manage issues of the project in a timely manner.

Everyone is friendly and reachable in our team. We respected each person's work and took advice from each other with an open mind. We had a great time working together and learned a lot from each other in the whole process.

### - Git workflow
Apart from early documenting, component listing and separated frontend and backend, Git plays an essential role along the whole process. The detail of our team use of Git is [here](../Sprints/README.md/#_git).

## 2. Conclusion on success of the project

Overall we have achieved as a group the objectives we set at the beginning of the project. We have delivered a working web application of an idea we crafted in the early phase of this unit. Although UI design of our webpages might be polished a little bit with more intuitive design insight according to the opinion of half of the users in our massive user acceptance test, it looks good in other aspects.


<a name="_2.1"></a>
### - A checklist of success evaluation

| No. | objectives | achieve or not | comments |
| --- | ---------- | -------------- | -------- |
| 1 | Build up a web application with MEAN stack | achieve | We built a completely working web application with `MongoDB`, `Express`, `Angular` and `Node.js`. |
| 2 | Address a serious problem in the real world | achieve | We addressed in the game that it's important to have a good coding habit and always pay attention to code quality with several examples. | 
| 3 | The web app is "serious play" with playful features | achieve | We used shit code theme with cute shit icons throughout the game.<br/>The game is set as a quiz which is much practical.<br/>Around 50% of the users think it is a playful game. |
| 4 | Fulfill the functions of the game | achieve | The functions set in UX design were all fulfilled at the end which could be briefly concluded as introduction, finding out shit code and getting report. |
| 5 | Use Angular to complete frontend construction | achieve | We designed and implemented three main components (welcome, question, report) and several data services on the frontend. |
| 6 | Use Express to complete backend construction | achieve | We designed and implemented three main APIs (question, report, submit) to get request and post request. |
| 7 | Use MangoDB to manage the storage of data | achieve | We stored our dynamic data (history correct num, history answer num) on MangoDB and designed a database model and schema for that. |
| 8 | Deploy on Docker | achieve | We deployed our whole application on Docker which makes setting up instances of Node and Mongo very easy. Everyone can easily recreate our production system. |
| 9 | Implement full testing | achieve | We completed unit test, functional test and user acceptance test to make sure all functions and interaction work correctly as expected. |
| 10 | Make a positive influence on raising awareness of code quality | achieve | Over 75% of the users think through the game they have realized the big difference between good code and shit code and they are willing to pay more attention to code quality in the future. |

## 3. How coronavirus has affected the project

This work has been impacted by the global pandemic COVID-19, as 2 out of 5 group members stay in China and all of our works and meetings have to be carried out online. Besides, the 7-hour time difference made communication harder. 

The difficulties and obstacles are also reflected in the following aspects.

<a name="_3.1"></a>
### - Pair programming
We can't do pair programming in person which is very necessary for frontend team in some ways. We have to use video calls and share screen as an alternative, which is not that efficient.

<a name="_3.2"></a>
### - UI design
It's a big challenge when we can't do UI design in person as a group. It took much more effort every time we discussed and adjusted the style, color, font and format of every detail of user interface. It's a little frustrated we can't sit together in a big room to display our ideas with paper and pencil. As a result, it limited the implementation of our design and influenced the final UI effect of our product to some extent.

<a name="_3.3"></a>
### - Think-aloud evaluation
We have to implement our user acceptance testing online and collect feedback through questionnaires. We can't do think-aloud formative user testing in person which would be better for us to collect response directly from users who are able to say aloud what they are thinking on site with our observer and facilitator in think-aloud evaluation.

## 4. Social and Ethical implications

To reduce the potential ethical risks of IT professionals, all developers in our team follow the [BCS Code of Conduct](https://www.bcs.org/membership/become-a-member/bcs-code-of-conduct/) when developing the product. Regarding the ethical integrity of our product design, we apply a framework that is particular focused in gamification - “[Open Gamification Code of Ethics](https://ethics.gamified.uk)” to support our analysis. 

<a name="_4.1"></a>
### - Social benefits
We designed our quiz game in hopes of providing incentives for programming beginners to learn about code quality and develop good coding habits. Besides educational acquisition for individual players, the product also has a profound influence on the SE education and the ecosystem of software development. In SE education, our game will attract lecturers and students’ attention to the topic of code quality and hence more programming learners will get the opportunity to know about code quality issues and relevant concepts. Regarding the ecosystem of software development, above benefits will accumulate and finally contribute to the improvement of the SE ecosystem. It is because people’s behavior of code writing will be changed positively, thus the cost and risk related to code quality is greatly reduced, and the productivity in the SE community and society increases.

<a name="_4.2"></a>
### - Honesty & Integrity
In terms of honesty, all the data we used in this report are authentic, some of which are approximations. The data sources are literatures and our real users. All the answered data and survey data collected have got the user’s ethical approval.

In terms of Integrity, since the topic is just about identification of code smell from good code, and all the contents in principles and options are checked ethical compliant, we can conclude that there are not any illegal activities, breaks of regional social practices or human rights issues etc. in the gamification process of our product.

<a name="_4.3"></a>
### - Respect
For many people, the element of ‘shit’ and its emoji image is funny and ironic, so we choose it to represent code smell. However, there is also possibility that people might think the ‘shit’ as a symbol of unrespect, or impolite to those who used to write the similar ‘shit code’. Although this is not clear whether this could be an issue, our solution plan to this is to add some statements in the welcome page to explain the hidden meaning of ‘shit’ to avoid misunderstand.

<a name="_4.4"></a>
### - Transparency
To encourage openness about the site to both players and investors, we clarify that the aims of our site, what data will be collected, how do we use and deal with the data in the introduction page of our site. 

In terms of the data usage, the answer status data are stored in the local storage of player’s browser, to reload the last answer status; the result of answer is submitted anonymously to the server, and store into our database to update the leaderboard. Data is only collected and used by our services and will not be shared with any other entities, unless users request.

In terms of data privacy and security, data in our product are not protected with a medium password, thus there is a risk that data breach will be exploited by hackers. However, all the data collected and used are not sensitive personal data, so our site still complies with GDPR. When the site is expanded to more functions and need to include biometric data, the data privacy and security management should be put on the agenda.

## 5. Future work

<a name="_5.1"></a>
### - Design part
The shitcode website is designed originally to educate new coders about the importance of good code style. To achieve this, a form of quiz game is taken. Actually, there are some more ways to explore and can be added to the website. For example, involve users to help add more shitcode from their practice to enrich more good and bad code style in the database, or create a community of sharing good and bad practice of coding.

<a name="_5.2"></a>
### - Development part
Although this website is about code style, unfortunately, our team does not have a code style regulation for developing due to unfamiliarity with js, html. This brings some mess when integrating. A great development team must have a clear, consistent code style as it helps with management and avoid possible bugs.
Angular and express is quite good for implementing prototype website. However, when a website becomes popular and functions become complex, stronger framework for backend like spring for Java can be a better choice to deal with possible issues like huge traffic.

<a name="_5.3"></a>
### - Evaluation part
Our team did our best for testing the website among classmates, but still, the scale of test sample is still not satisfying, we are looking forward to spreading the website further and getting more useful advice.
The target user of this website is for new coder, but we only have classmates who have learnt coding for over half year and knew code style since last TB. In the future, we need to do testing on real new coders to see if they find it helpful for raising awareness of writing not only correct but good-styled code.

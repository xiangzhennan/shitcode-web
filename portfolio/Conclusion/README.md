### - Design part
The shitcode website is designed originally to educate new coders about the importance of good code style. To achieve this, a form of quiz game is taken. Actually, there are some more ways to explore and can be added to the website. For example, involve users to help add more shitcode from their practice to enrich more good and bad code style in the database, or create a community of sharing good and bad practice of coding.

### - Development part
Although this website is about code style, unfortunately, our team does not have a code style regulation for developing due to unfamiliarity with js, html. This brings some mess when integrating. A great development team must have a clear, consistent code style as it helps with management and avoid possible bugs.
Angular and express is quite good for implementing prototype website. However, when a website becomes popular and functions become complex, stronger framework for backend like spring for Java can be a better choice to deal with possible issues like huge traffic.

### - Evaluation part
Our team did our best for testing the website among classmates, but still, the scale of test sample is still not satisfying, we are looking forward to spreading the website further and getting more useful advice.
The target user of this website is for new coder, but we only have classmates who have learnt coding for over half year and knew code style since last TB. In the future, we need to do testing on real new coders to see if they find it helpful for raising awareness of writing not only correct but good-styled code.

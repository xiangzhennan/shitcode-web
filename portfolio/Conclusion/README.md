## 1. Conclusion on working practices of the group

The key part of the success of the project is efficient team play. The final completion is based on everyone's hard work and commitment to the team.

<a name="_1.1"></a>
### - Agile development (complete four sprint cycles)
This project has followed closely with agile development principles. We designed the system around user needs and kept them as our top priority. We were open to changes and adapted them quickly once they rose. We have been working on development at a progressive pace, following our [timeline](../Sprints/timeline_chart.png). After each sprint we measured the progress by testing and review before moving on to the next sprint. 

We focused on coding implementation and tried to do our best with what we have. We minimized unnecessary work when adapting changes to our goal. We divided ourselves into two sub-groups with 2-3 teammates in each. Within each sub-group we organized tasks for our own and reflect regularly on what had been achieved.

### - Team communication
We arranged twice video calls on Teams weekly to make sure everyone would catch up with the progress as planned. Our integrated meeting logs are [here](../Sprints/meeting_log/README.md). After each group meeting, we would always make a conclusion based on our discussion and allocate related members to follow up the issues. We used WeChat group in our daily work to communicate and manage issues of the project in a timely manner.

Everyone is friendly and reachable in our team. We respected each person's work and took advice from each other with an open mind. We had a great time working together and learned a lot from each other in the process of the project.

### - Git workflow
Apart from early documenting, component listing and separated frontend and backend, Git plays an essential role along the whole process. The detail of our team use of Git is [here](../Sprints/README.md/#_git).

## 3. How coronavirus has affected the project

This work has been impacted by the global pandemic COVID-19, as 2 out of 5 group members stay in China and all of our works and meetings have to be carried out online. Besides, the 7-hour time difference made communication harder. 

The difficulties and obstacles are also reflected in the following aspects.

<a name="_3.1"></a>
### - Pair programming
We can't do pair programming in person which is very necessary for frontend team in some ways. We have to use video calls and share screen as an alternative, which is not that efficient.

<a name="_3.2"></a>
### - UI design
It's a big challenge when we can't do UI design in person as a group. It took much more effort every time we discussed and adjusted the style, color, font and format of every detail of user interface. It's a little frustrated we can't sit together in a big room to display our ideas with paper and pencil. As a result, it limited the implementation of our design and influenced the final UI effect of our product to some extent.

<a name="_3.3"></a>
### - Think-aloud evaluation
We have to implement our user acceptance testing online and collect feedback through questionnaires. We can't do think-aloud formative user testing in person which would be better for us to collect response directly from users who are able to say aloud what they are thinking on site with our observer and facilitator in think-aloud evaluation.

## 5. Future work

### - Design part
The shitcode website is designed originally to educate new coders about the importance of good code style. To achieve this, a form of quiz game is taken. Actually, there are some more ways to explore and can be added to the website. For example, involve users to help add more shitcode from their practice to enrich more good and bad code style in the database, or create a community of sharing good and bad practice of coding.

<a name="_5.2"></a>
### - Development part
Although this website is about code style, unfortunately, our team does not have a code style regulation for developing due to unfamiliarity with js, html. This brings some mess when integrating. A great development team must have a clear, consistent code style as it helps with management and avoid possible bugs.
Angular and express is quite good for implementing prototype website. However, when a website becomes popular and functions become complex, stronger framework for backend like spring for Java can be a better choice to deal with possible issues like huge traffic.

<a name="_5.3"></a>
### - Evaluation part
Our team did our best for testing the website among classmates, but still, the scale of test sample is still not satisfying, we are looking forward to spreading the website further and getting more useful advice.
The target user of this website is for new coder, but we only have classmates who have learnt coding for over half year and knew code style since last TB. In the future, we need to do testing on real new coders to see if they find it helpful for raising awareness of writing not only correct but good-styled code.

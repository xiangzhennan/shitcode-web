## Early prototyping and ideation

To design and build a web app that is based around the concept of “serious play” which addresses a serious issue but using playful techniques to engage audiences, we used design thinking to generate the idea of our project.

### - Design thinking

During design thinking, we followed the process as below.
* **Discover**<br/>
Discover a real-world problem or a serious issue around us. Speak to people who are affected by the issues.
* **Define**<br/>
Define the challenge of the problems gathered from the discovery phase in a different way.
* **Develop**<br/>
Give different answers to the clearly defined problem, seeking inspiration from elsewhere.
* **Deliver**<br/>
Test out different solutions at small-scale, reject those that will not work and improve the ones that will.

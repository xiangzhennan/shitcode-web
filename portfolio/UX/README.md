## Early prototyping and ideation

<a name="_1.1"></a>
### - Early ideation and mood boards

We brainstormed a list of several forms of game, like kicking a ball, gambling, rolling dice, trading. We also listed several serious topics, like garbage sorting to protect environment, finding buying partner to share order and reduce waste, shit-code tutorial to help new coder get rid of bad coding habit.
Then we created a matrix to populate the axes with these play items and problems for further decision.

After several rounds of discussion and voting, we finally chose the idea about shitcode which is very close to our current situation and needs. Having found that most learning is by trying out challenging problems and reflecting on them, we decided to design a quiz game to address the problem about bad coding habit and promote active learning experience.

## Identification of interacting users and broader stakeholders

Our system is mainly designed for two types of end user: coding novice and coding lover. Online coding community is also our broader stakeholder.

<a name="_2.1"></a>
* **End user - coding novice**<br/>
The coding novice is a group of people who are new to programming, like computer science related students. They are in the process of systematically learning programming. As a beginner, they need to learn good practice of coding in order to build up good coding habit at the beginning.

* **End user - coding lover**<br/>
The coding lover is a group of people who have much interest in coding but not major in it or work on it. They may like to study coding by themselves in their free time and their main tutorial might be materials online. The game is a good supplement to their self-study.

<a name="_2.3"></a>
* **Broader stakeholder - online coding community**<br/>
Developers tend to like discussing problems they meet in an online coding community. So there is much coding experience in practice that could be found in those online communities. This could be a good example for teaching which is good code and identifying which is shit code, which would be a good source to enrich database of quiz questions.

## UX approach

A UX approach involves deeply understanding the users through research, organizing information, visual design (and more), all with the goal of meeting user needs and doing it elegantly. It involves putting users at the centre of the design and development process, and establishing an iterative cycle of research, design and evaluation.

* **Research**<br/>
Perform initial user research to help understand the target audience (capabilities, limitations, goals, expectations) and their tasks.
* **Design**<br/>
User research insights are used to help generate ideas and early designs. Prototyping can be used to bring concepts to life.
* **Evaluation**<br/>
Capture user feedback, and to measure the delivered UX throughout a project.

We used the following approaches to improve our UX design in the whole process of development.

### - Design thinking

To design and build a web app that is based around the concept of “serious play” which addresses a serious issue but using playful techniques to engage audiences, we used **design thinking** to generate the idea of our project. 

During design thinking, we followed the process as below.
* **Discover**<br/>
Discover a real-world problem or a serious issue around us. Speak to people who are affected by the issues.
* **Define**<br/>
Define the challenge of the problems gathered from the discovery phase in a different way.
* **Develop**<br/>
Give different answers to the clearly defined problem, seeking inspiration from elsewhere.
* **Deliver**<br/>
Test out different solutions at small-scale, reject those that will not work and improve the ones that will.

### - Prototyping and think-loud

Paper prototyping is a user-centred design method that involves the development of user interface mock-ups and drawn sketches which are presented to end users for evaluation.

We involved our users to better conceptualise our product and visualise how it will be used. Feedback from end-user Emma is listed as below.
* **Product concept and goals**<br/>
```I think it's very clear for the game to choose out shitcode in order to get scores as high as possible.```
* **Logic and flow of user journeys**<br/>
```I think the logic of the game is very simple to understand, easy to play.```
* **The form of the user interface**<br/>
```Using cute shit elements and images to display result of my answer to each question is very vivid and fits the shit-code theme.```

This really tested our hypothesis and helped us to better understand our product and users.

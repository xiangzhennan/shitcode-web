## Early prototyping and ideation

To design and build a web app that is based around the concept of “serious play” which addresses a serious issue but using playful techniques to engage audiences, we used **design thinking** to generate the idea of our project.

### - Design thinking

During design thinking, we followed the process as below.
* **Discover**<br/>
Discover a real-world problem or a serious issue around us. Speak to people who are affected by the issues.
* **Define**<br/>
Define the challenge of the problems gathered from the discovery phase in a different way.
* **Develop**<br/>
Give different answers to the clearly defined problem, seeking inspiration from elsewhere.
* **Deliver**<br/>
Test out different solutions at small-scale, reject those that will not work and improve the ones that will.

### - Early ideation and mood boards

We brainstormed a list of several forms of game, like kicking a ball, gambling, rolling dice, trading. We also listed several serious topics, like garbage sorting to protect environment, finding buying partner to share order and reduce waste, shit-code tutorial to help new coder get rid of bad coding habit.
Then we created a matrix to populate the axes with these play items and problems for further decision.

After several rounds of discussion and voting, we finally chose the idea about shitcode which is very close to our current situation and needs. Having found that most learning is by trying out challenging problems and reflecting on them, we decided to design a quiz game to address the problem about bad coding habit and promote active learning experience.

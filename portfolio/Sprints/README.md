## Group working methods

To develop an application in a group, we apply the principles of DevOps and stick to the selected methodology to keep out project on track and moving at a constant pace.

### Workflow
We take an iterative approach to workflow management and break down larger issues into smaller units of work to help us meet our goals faster. Our workflow includes the following four states.
* **TO DO**
   Work that has not been started
* **IN PROGRESS**
  Work that is actively being looked at by the team
* **CODE REVIEW**
  Work that is completed and awaiting review
* **DONE**
  Work that is completely finished and meets the team's definition of done
